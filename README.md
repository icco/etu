# etu

A react based wiki.

The idea here is for Nat to create documents that describe his side projects. It also exists to track his work on side projects. This is only the frontend, all data is stored in [graphql](https://github.com/icco/graphql).

## Inspiration

Etu is [the personifcation of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_fate_deities) according to the [Lakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people).

Etu is inspired heavily by the work of @neauoire at [wiki.xxiivv.com](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#about).
