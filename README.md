# Etu

A personal wiki. Data is stored in graphql.

## Inspiration

Etu is [the personifcation of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_fate_deities) according to the [Lakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people).

Etu is inspired heavily by the work of @neauoire at [wiki.xxiivv.com](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#about), [Andy's Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org), and the screenshots in the [inspiration](https://github.com/icco/etu/tree/main/inspiration) folder.

## Design

Etu stores a series of time entries. Each entry contains

 - Start Time
 - Stop Time (defaults to 30 minutes?)
 - Type of Activity?
 - Description / Log
