# Etu

A personal time tracker. Data is stored in graphql.

## Inspiration

Etu is [the personifcation of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_fate_deities) according to the [Lakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people).

Etu is inspired heavily by the work of @neauoire at [wiki.xxiivv.com](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#about), [Time Travelers](https://github.com/merveilles/Time-Travelers), and the screenshots in the [inspiration](https://github.com/icco/etu/tree/main/inspiration) folder.

## History

I've rewritten this aproximately four times. Originally I made this to be a location based blogging app. Then it turned into a time tracking app. Then into a wiki. Finally, its current form is again a time tracking app.
